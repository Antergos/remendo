# Remendo

## How it is supposed to work

 * Thanks to inotify, pacman-monitoring knows when /usr/bin/pacman is opened. At this moment, remendo triggers itself.
 * Downloads a XML file from http://install.antergos.com/events.xml which contains the possible events to be fixed.
	* The XML has the event ID, which is a number, the event name and description, and the URL where Remendo will download the script to fix the system once the user says yes to Remendo [more fields to be added]
 * Detects if the user has some pending events. Remendo should check if the user needs to fix the issue or if he already solved it manually.
 * Pauses the pacman process and show up an UI asking the user what to do.
	* The user will have information on the screen of Event's name with a short description and URL to possible announcement of the fix.
	* The user will have to choose between "Fixme the problem" or "I'm gonna do it manually" option.
 * If the user choose "I'm gonna do it manually", Remendo should mark the event as read and pacman should be reanudated.
 * If the user choose "Fixme the problem", Remendo will download the script provided in the XML URL field and execute this script.
	* After finishind sucessfully the event fix, Remendo will mark it as read


## Possible events

 * Changed package name: We provide the user with a package that has now changed its name and it doesn't depend on any other package, so there's no way we could do it quietly (E.g.: hotot-data-git to hotot-data)
 * New announcement in Arch Linux website: Remendo should warn the user about it and if we didn't provide an event ID in the XML yet, show only the URL to get more information with some message like "Something has changed, but we didn't have time to look at it yet... or we're still working on it."
 * Suggest new software developed by our team released in new ISOs to let the user know about them.

## How can remendo manage the events

 * On first run, remendo can create a file database with the current date. New events will only be shown to the user after that date. It can be that the user first installed the system and later on Remendo, having some possible events that he wants to solve with it, but I can't think of any other idea.
 * The database is updated with new events, marked as "Solved", "Manually Solved" or "Not Solved".
 * The database can be located in /usr/share/remendo/database.db
